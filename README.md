repository practice

My name is Marquise and I'm learning web development. It started as just an interest in graphic design, but, after some time and research, this lead me to HTML. This being the case, my interest is primarily in front-end development. However, to make sites as dynamic as I envision them, knowledge of the back-end is a must. Now, in my web development journey I've discovered the importance of Git and version control. This repository will serve as practice for me to hone my coding skills, while also teaching me how to use Github.
